I"∞<p>I am a geoscientist passionate about magmatism, volcanology, geochemistry, and machine learning.</p>

<p>Since 2019, I work as a Ma√Ætre de Conf√©rences (Assistant Professor) at IPGP in Paris, France, on various questions related to those themes. In addition to those, I also am interested in computer programming, optimisation and machine learning, and their use to solve problems related to volcanic systems and the Earth.</p>

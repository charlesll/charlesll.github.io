I"∫<p>I am a geoscientist passionate about magmatism, volcanology, geochemistry, and machine learning.</p>

<p>Since 2019, I work as a Ma√Ætre de Conf√©rences (Assistant Professor) at the IPGP in Paris, France, on various topics related to those domains. 
In addition to those themes, I also am interested in computer programming, optimisation and machine learning, and their use to solve problems related to volcanic systems and the Earth.</p>

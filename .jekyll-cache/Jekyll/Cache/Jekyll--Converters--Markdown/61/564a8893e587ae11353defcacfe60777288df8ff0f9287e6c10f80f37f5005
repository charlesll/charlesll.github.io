<p>Two courses are also available on Github.</p>

<p><strong>Geochemical Modelling</strong>: the material of this course I teach at IPGP can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/charlesll/ModelisationGeochimie">here</a></p>

<p><strong>Computational Geoscience Course</strong> I taught this course while I was a Research Fellow at ANU, with Andrew Valentine and Oscar Branson. It is a good starting point for anyone wanting to learn computing. You can find the material <a href="https://github.com/valentineap/ComputationalGeoscienceCourse">here</a>, updated frequently by Andrew Valentine !</p>

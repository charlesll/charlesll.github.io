Analytical methods for glass characterization. In the glass industry, knowledge of the chemical composition and atomic structural of glasses is important for quality control on production sites or for the research and development of new products. In this chapter, we will brieﬂy describe different methods that can be used to easily obtain pieces of information regarding the glass atomic structure and composition, the composition of unmelted particles, or even the oxidation state of the multivalent elements inﬂuencing the optical properties of the ﬁnal glass products.}, number={4}, journal={Matériaux & Techniques}, author={Le Losq, Charles and Tarrago, Mariona and Blanc, Wilfried and Georges, Peggy and Hennet, Louis and Zanghi, Didier and Lelong, Gérald and Pannefieu, Salomé and Neuville, Daniel R.}, editor={Capilla, Xavier and Angeli, Frédéric and Neuville, Daniel R.}, year={2022}, pages={403}, language={fr} }

A remarkable record of the early evolution of Hawaiian volcanoes, however, is preserved by a volcanic sandstone dredged from the submarine flank of Kilauea, which contains a suite of petrogenetically related pre-shield basanite to nephelinite glasses. Here we show that the systematic variation in the rare earth element (REE) patterns of these samples requires the fractional crystallisation of garnet. A fractionating assemblage of Ca-rich garnet (32%), omphacitic clinopyroxene (63%), and minor phlogopite can explain the variation in the major and trace element contents of the suite. The results suggest fractional crystallisation of eclogite from a primitive Hawaiian melt near the base of the lithosphere (>90 km) and that a deep magma chamber is the first stage in the development of a Hawaiian volcano.}, number={11}, journal={Nature Communications}, publisher={Nature Publishing Group}, author={Miller, Laura A. and O’Neill, Hugh St C. and Berry, Andrew J. and Le Losq, Charles}, year={2022}, month={May}, pages={2946}, language={en} }

It may be trivalent under very reduced conditions, but this remains unclear. In this study, in situ Ti K-edge XANES experiments were performed on four different Ti-bearing melts, equilibrated at high temperatures using a micro-furnace with controlled atmosphere. No formation of Ti3+ was observed, even at fO2 ~ 10− 15 (estimated). Instead, systematic crystallisation of the melts was observed. In experiments at fO2 ≤ 10− 12, the system favours Ti4+ crystallisation instead of reduction to Ti3+ in the studied melts. Fluxing melts with reduced gas mixtures, like Ar-2%H2, may be a novel way to induce surface crystal­ lisation and produce ceramic-coated glass materials.}, journal={Materials Letters}, author={Tarrago, Mariona and Le Losq, Charles and Robine, Thibaut and Reguer, Solenn and Thiaudière, Dominique and Neuville, Daniel R.}, year={2022}, month={Jul}, pages={132296}, language={en} }

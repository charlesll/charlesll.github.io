        title={Viscosity of crystal-free silicate melts from the active submarine volcanic chain of Mayotte}, volume={620}, ISSN={00092541}, DOI={10.1016/j.chemgeo.2023.121326}, abstractNote={Following an unprecedented seismic activity that started in May 2018, a new volcanic edifice, now called Fani Maor´e, was constructed on the ocean floor 50 km east of the island of Mayotte (Indian Ocean). This volcano is the latest addition to a volcanic chain characterized by an alkaline basanite-to-phonolite magmatic differentiation trend. Here, we performed viscosity measurements on five silicate melts representative of the East-Mayotte Volcanic Chain compositional trend: two basanites from Fani Maor´e, one tephriphonolite and two phonolites from different parts of the volcanic chain. A concentric cylinder viscometer was employed at super-liquidus conditions between 1500 K and 1855 K and a creep apparatus was used for measuring the viscosity of the undercooled melts close to the glass transition temperature in the air. At super-liquidus temperatures, basanites have the lowest viscosity (0.11–0.34 to 0.99–1.16 log10 Pa⸱s), phonolites the highest (1.75–1.91 to 3.10–3.89 log10 Pa⸱s), while the viscosity of the tephriphonolite falls in between (0.89–1.97 log10 Pa⸱s). Near the glass transition, viscosity measurements were performed for one phonolite melt because obtaining pure glass samples for the basanite and tephriphonolite compositions was unsuccessful. This is due to the formation of nanolites upon quench as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy. The phonolite viscosity ranges from of 10.19 log10 Pa⸱s at 1058 K to 12.30 log10 Pa⸱s at 986 K. Comparison with existing empirical models reveals an underestimation of 1.2 to 2.0 log units at super-liquidus and undercooled temperatures, respectively, for the phonolite. This em­ phasizes (i) the lack of data falling along the alkaline basanite-to-phonolite magmatic differentiation trend to calibrate empirical models, and (ii) the complexity of modeling viscosity variations as a function of temperature and chemical composition for alkaline compositions. The new measurements indicate that, at eruptive tem­ peratures between 1050 ◦C and 1150 ◦C (1323–1423 K), the oxidized, anhydrous, crystal-free and bubble-free basanite melt have a viscosity around 2.6 log10 Pa⸱s. In contrast, the anhydrous phonolite crystal- and bubblefree melt would have a viscosity around 6–10 log10 Pa⸱s at expected eruptive temperatures, from 800 to 1000 ◦C (1073–1273 K). Considering that both basanite and phonolite lavas from the Mayotte submarine vol­ canic chain contain <6% crystals and a significant amount of water (1-2.3 wt% and 0.8-1.2 wt%, respectively), such viscosity values are probably upper limits. The new viscosity measurements are essential to define eruptive models and to better understand the storage and transport dynamics of Comoros Archipelago magmas, and of alkaline magmas in general, from the source to the surface.}, journal={Chemical Geology}, author={Verdurme, Pauline and Le Losq, Charles and Chevrel, Oryaëlle and Pannefieu, Salomé and Médard, Etienne and Berthod, Carole and Komorowski, Jean-Christophe and Bachèlery, Patrick and Neuville, Daniel R. and Gurioli, Lucia}, year={2023}, month={Mar}, pages={121326}, language={en} }

However, the physical behaviour of magma oceans is poorly understood, as the high liquidus temperatures and rapid quench rates required to preserve peridotite liquids as glasses have so far limited their investigation. In order to better characterize the atomic structure and estimate the physical properties of such glasses, we examined the Raman spectra of quenched peridotite melts, equilibrated at 1900 °C ± 50 °C at ambient pressure under different oxygen fugacities (fO2), from 1.9 log units below to 6.0 log units above the Iron-Wüstite buffer. Fitting the spectra with Gaussian components assigned to different molecular entities (Q-species) permits extraction of the mean state of polymerisation of the glass. We find that the proportions of Q1 (0.36–0.32), Q2 (0.50–0.43), and Q3 (0.16–0.23) vary with Fe3+/FeTOT (FeTOT = Fe2+ + Fe3+), where increasing Fe3+/FeTOT produces an increase in Q3 at the expense of Q2 at near-constant Q1. To account for the offset between Raman-derived NBO/T (2.06–2.27) with those determined by assuming Fe2+ exists entirely as a network modifier and Fe3+ a network former (2.10–2.44), ∼2/3 of the ferric iron and ∼90% of the ferrous iron in peridotite glasses must behave as network modifiers. We employ a deep neural network model, trained to predict alkali and alkaline-earth aluminosilicate melts properties, to observe how small variations in the atomic structure of peridotite-like melts affect their viscosity. For Fe-free peridotite-like melts, the model yields a viscosity of ∼ −1.75 log Pa s at 2000 °C, similar to experimental determinations for iron-bearing peridotite melts. The model predicts that changes in the peridotite melt atomic structure with Fe3+/FeTOT yield variations in melt viscosity lower than 0.1 log Pa s, barely affecting the Rayleigh number. Therefore, at the high temperatures typical of magma oceans, at least at 1 bar, small changes in melt structure from variations in oxidation state are unlikely to affect magma ocean fluid dynamics.}, journal={Frontiers in Earth Science}, author={Le Losq, Charles and Sossi, Paolo A.}, year={2023} , selected={true} }

Part 1: Partition Coefficients and Volatile Evolution Accompanying Fluid- and Redox-Induced Sulfide Formation}, volume={10}, ISSN={2296-6463}, url={https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.867979}, abstractNote={We report abundances of major trace and volatile elements in an orthopyroxenite vein cutting a sub-arc, mantle-derived, spinel harzburgite xenolith from Kamchatka. The orthopyroxenite contains abundant sulfides and is characterized by the presence of glass (formerly melt) both interstitially and as inclusions in minerals, comparable with similar veins from the West Bismarck arc. The glass formed by quenching of residual melts following crystallization of abundant orthopyroxene, amphibole, and minor olivine and spinel. The interstitial glass has a low-Ti, high-Mg# andesite composition, with a wide range of H2O and S contents but more limited F and Cl variations. We calculate trace element partition coefficients using mineral and glass data, including those for halogens in amphibole, which agree with experimental results from the literature. Despite having a similar, high-Mg# andesite composition, the orthopyroxene-hosted glass inclusions usually contain much more H2O and S than the interstitial glass (4–7 wt% and ∼2,600 ppm, respectively). The initial vein-forming melts were oxidized, recording oxygen fugacity conditions up to ∼1.5 log units above the fayalite–magnetite–quartz oxygen buffer. They intruded the sub-arc mantle lithosphere at ≥1,300°C, where they partially crystallized to form high-Mg# andesitic derivative melts at ca. 1,050–1,100°C. Comparison with literature data on glass-free orthopyroxenite veins from Kamchatka and the glass-bearing ones from West Bismarck reveals fundamental similarities indicating common parental melts, which were originally produced by low-degree melting (≤5%) of spinel harzburgite at ≥1,360°C and ≤1.5 GPa. This harzburgite source likely contained ≤0.05 wt% H2O and a few ppm of halogens. Volatile evolution inferred from glass compositions shows that (i) redox exchange between S6+ in the original melt and Fe2+ in the host mantle minerals, together with (ii) the formation of an S-bearing, (H2O, Cl)-rich hydrothermal fluid from the original melt, provides the conditions for the formation of abundant sulfides in the orthopyroxenites during cooling. During this process, up to 85% of the original melt S content (∼2,600 ppm) is locally precipitated as magmatic and hydrothermal sulfides. As such, melts derived from spinel harzburgite sources can concentrate chalcophile and highly siderophile metals in orthopyroxenite dykes and sills in the lithosphere.}, journal={Frontiers in Earth Science}, author={Bénard, A. and Le Losq, C. and Müntener, O. and Robyr, M. and Nebel, O. and Arculus, R.

Here, we performed a series of hydrothermal diamond-anvil cell experiments to evaluate the role of pressure, temperature, and redox conditions on the speciation and intermolecular fractionations of H and N during the decompression and cooling of aqueous fluids from 780 MPa to 800°C to 150 MPa and 200°C. We used Raman spectroscopy to investigate the distribution and exchange reactions of H and N isotopologues between water, methane, ammonia, and di-nitrogen molecules under changing physicochemical conditions. Our experiments show that upon decompression, a C- and N-bearing fluid will preferentially degas D-rich methane and 15N-rich N2, depleting the residual aqueous fluid in those isotopes. If this fluid precipitates N-rich (i.e., NH4+-bearing) minerals, the observed N isotopic fractionation is opposite to that during N2 degassing, enriching the aqueous fluid in 15N. Because these fractionations result from changes in H, C, and N speciation in the aqueous fluid, their magnitudes depend on redox conditions as well as pressure and temperature. Our new in-situ experimental results are consistent with the large H and N isotopic fractionations observed between water, methane, and ammonia species in aqueous fluids at high pressures and temperatures, although the magnitude of the fractionations in our experiments cannot be quantified. Nonetheless, our results suggest that statistical thermodynamic models likely underestimate isotopic fractionation effects for isotopic molecules under these conditions, and should account for solubility and isotopic effects of the solvent associated with the solvation of water, methane, and ammonia isotopologues in aqueous fluids.This work has significant implications for interpreting isotopic measurements of natural samples from hydrothermal systems because it offers insights into isotopic fractionations in multicomponent and multiphase systems under hydrothermal temperatures and pressures.}, journal={Frontiers in Earth Science}, author={Dalou, Celia and Le Losq, Charles and Füri, Evelyn and Caumon, Marie-Camille}, year={2022} }

A remarkable record of the early evolution of Hawaiian volcanoes, however, is preserved by a volcanic sandstone dredged from the submarine flank of Kilauea, which contains a suite of petrogenetically related pre-shield basanite to nephelinite glasses. Here we show that the systematic variation in the rare earth element (REE) patterns of these samples requires the fractional crystallisation of garnet. A fractionating assemblage of Ca-rich garnet (32%), omphacitic clinopyroxene (63%), and minor phlogopite can explain the variation in the major and trace element contents of the suite.

        title={Raman spectroscopy to determine CO2 solubility in mafic silicate melts at high pressure: Haplobasaltic, haploandesitic and approach of basaltic compositions}, volume={582}, ISSN={0009-2541}, DOI={10.1016/j.chemgeo.2021.120413}, abstractNote={CO2 degassing of mafic silicate melts is an important part of the terrestrial carbon cycle, at mid-ocean ridges, oceanic hot spots, or in the middle of continents. Deeper CO2-bearing mafic magmas may also exist, such as those suspected in the D″ zone, and certainly existed in the magma ocean of the early Earth. Knowledge of the CO2 solubility in mafic melts at high pressure is therefore important but unknown at present. Results from molecular dynamics simulation (e.g., Guillot and Sator, 2011) predict that CO2 solubility in basalt may be much higher than previously thought at pressures and temperatures relevant to the upper mantle. But some recent models predict low solubility at high pressure (e.g., Eguchi and Dasgupta, 2018). The present study thus experimentally investigates the solubility of CO2 in basalt and andesite in the pressure range 1.5–8.5 GPa at 1820–2130 K in oxidizing conditions. Up to 4 GPa, the quenched samples are essentially vitreous and CO2-saturated. Their CO2 contents are measured using confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy, where we establish an internal calibration line relating CO2 content to the area of the Raman band assigned to the ν1 stretching vibration of carbonate groups. This calibration appears independent from the spectrometer, sample or experimentalist, thus enhancing confidence in this method. At 5 and 8.5 GPa, some of the quenched samples are found partially crystallized. Their CO2 abundance is estimated at micro-scale from Raman mapping, and at large scale from image analysis and presence/absence of vesicles. Over the 1.5–8.5 GPa pressure range, obtained CO2 concentrations vary between 1.8 and > 13.6 wt%. At 5 GPa and 1873 K, the CO2 content in basalt and andesite are similar. These findings experimentally confirm the ability of mafic melts to accommodate large amounts of CO2 at conditions prevailing in the deep Earth. A consequence is that magmas issued from partial melting of carbonate-bearing silicate rocks may ascend with significant quantities of CO2 of several wt% and more: when reaching shallower depths, they may degas large quantities of CO2. Present estimates of the global carbon flux to the atmosphere may thus be underestimated, and implications to early magma ocean degassing may be considered. Other consequences may concern the genesis of kimberlites and carbonatites. We finally speculate that, if silicate melts exist in the D″ zone, significant amounts of carbon may be stored there, and consequences may arise as to carbon sequestration in the core.}, journal={Chemical Geology}, author={Amalberti, Julien and Sarda, Philippe and Le Losq, Charles and Sator, Nicolas and Hammouda, Tahar and Chamorro-Pérez, Eva and Guillot, Bertrand and Le Floch, Sylvie and Neuville, Daniel R.}, year={2021}, month={Nov}, pages={120413}, language={en} }

The precise mode of Pt incorporation is however unclear, as it can occur as Pt0, Pt2+ or Pt4+, either on the surface, as dispersed inclusions, or as part of the hematite crystal lattice. These different Pt-doping varieties can have major effects on the hematite performance. Here, we employ a high-pressure synthesis method assisted by silicate liquid flux to grow Pt-doped hematite crystals large enough for elemental analysis by wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS). We find that the total cations are lower than the expected 2 atoms per formula unit, and together with Fe, they are inversely correlated with Pt contents. Linear regressions in compositional space reveal that the slopes are consistent with 4Fe3+ = 3Pt4+ + VFe as the charge-balanced substitution mechanism. Therefore, Pt4+-doping of hematite at high oxygen fugacities, which does not allow Fe2+ to form, will lead to removal of Fe and formation of cation vacancies. Our hematite also contains significant Al3+, Ti4+ and Mg2+, raising the possibility of fine tuning the hematite properties by co-doping with other elements. Photoelectrochemical performance of cation vacancy bearing hematite is experimentally understudied and is a potentially promising future field of study.}, number={15}, journal={Materials Advances}, publisher={RSC}, author={Anenburg, Michael and Wykes, Jeremy L. and Troitzsch, Ulrike and Losq, Charles Le and Chen, Jeff}, year={2021}, month={Aug}, pages={5195–5202}, language={en} }

In past decades, the use of these elements in industrial processes has increased exponentially with the development of novel technologies and applications.

As a result, the study of lanthanides in materials, either as whole group or as single species, has become an important point of focus in both Geo- and Materials Sciences. Among REE, Ce and Eu are stable in many geological environments, with two different oxidation states (Ce 3+ /Ce 4+ and Eu 2+ /Eu 3+ ), hence, these two redox couples have been proposed as proxies for oxygen fugacity ( f O 2 ) in different environments (oxybarometer). However, it is essential to understand the factors influencing redox mechanisms in order to use Ce/Eu distribution as f O 2 sensors.

Profiles of defect-specific absorbance derived from FTIR spectra were fitted to solutions of Fick’s second law to derive diffusion coefficients, which yield the Arrhenius relationship for H diffusion in forsterite:</p> <div class="disp-formula" content-type="" id="Ch1.Ex1"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M24" display="block" overflow="scroll" dspmath="mathml"><mrow><msub><mi>log⁡</mi><mn mathvariant="normal">10</mn></msub><msub><mover accent="true"><mi>D</mi><mo stretchy="false" mathvariant="normal">̃</mo></mover><mrow><mo>[</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">001</mn><mo>]</mo></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mo>-</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2.5</mn><mo>±</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">0.6</mn><mspace linebreak="nobreak" width="0.125em"/><mo>+</mo><mspace width="0.125em" linebreak="nobreak"/><mstyle displaystyle="true"><mfrac style="display"><mrow><mo>-</mo><mo>(</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">224</mn><mo>±</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">12</mn><mspace linebreak="nobreak" width="0.125em"/><mspace linebreak="nobreak" width="0.125em"/><mo>+</mo><mspace width="0.125em" linebreak="nobreak"/><mn mathvariant="normal">4.0</mn><mo>±</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">2.0</mn><mspace width="0.125em" linebreak="nobreak"/><mi>P</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn mathvariant="normal">2.303</mn><mi>R</mi><mi>T</mi></mrow></mfrac></mstyle><mo>,</mo></mrow></math><div><svg:svg xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="257pt" height="26pt" class="svg-formula" dspmath="mathimg" md5hash="8804d1025486215874b85570914c7089"><svg:image xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ejm-33-113-2021-ue00001.svg" width="257pt" height="26pt" src="ejm-33-113-2021-ue00001.png"/></svg:svg></div></div> <p><span id="page114"/>where <span class="inline-formula"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M25" display="inline" overflow="scroll" dspmath="mathml"><mover accent="true"><mi>D</mi><mo mathvariant="normal" stretchy="false">̃</mo></mover></math><span><svg:svg xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10pt" height="12pt" class="svg-formula" dspmath="mathimg" md5hash="082cf7beca9d9aaa0c5a01f187655486"><svg:image xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ejm-33-113-2021-ie00001.svg" width="10pt" height="12pt" src="ejm-33-113-2021-ie00001.png"/></svg:svg></span></span> is the measured diffusion coefficient in m<span class="inline-formula">2</span> s<span class="inline-formula">−1</span>, valid for diffusion parallel to [001] and calibrated between 1000 and 750 <span class="inline-formula">∘</span>C, <span class="inline-formula">P</span> and <span class="inline-formula">T</span> are in GPa and K, and <span class="inline-formula">R</span> is 0.008314 kJK<span class="inline-formula">−1</span> mol<span class="inline-formula">−1</span>.

In general, Fe 2+ is a network modifier in the melt structure while Fe 3+ is a weak network former. The ratio Fe 3+ /(Fe 3+ +Fe 2+ ) depends on temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity, and melt composition. Parametric models allow its calculation, but the complex links between melt composition, iron oxidation state, and coordination can be further rationalized using a ionic-polymeric model. Constraining concentration and oxidation state of iron is critical for determining magma density and viscosity, which drive exchanges of matter and heat in the Earth. At high pressures, changes in the coordination of elements, including iron, yield a stiffening and densification of magmas, potentially influencing dynamic and geochemical processes. Near surface, crystallization of Fe-bearing phases changes the residual melt composition, including iron content and oxidation state as well as volatile concentration, ultimately driving large changes in density and viscosity of magmas, and, hence, in the dynamic of fluid flow in volcanic systems. The complex interplay between magma iron content and oxidation state, major element chemistry, crystal and volatile contents thus can play a large role on the dynamic of volcanic systems.}, booktitle={Magma Redox Geochemistry}, publisher={American Geophysical Union (AGU)}, author={Le Losq, C. and Cicconi, M.

They include most magmas, and are used to produce a wide variety of everyday materials, from windows to smartphone displays. Despite this importance, no general model exists with which to predict the atomic structure, thermodynamic and viscous properties of aluminosilicate melts. To address this, we introduce a deep learning framework, ‘i-Melt’, which combines a deep artificial neural network with thermodynamic equations. It is trained to predict 18 different latent and observed properties of melts and glasses in the K2O-Na2O-Al2O3-SiO2 system, including configurational entropy, viscosity, optical refractive index, density, and Raman signals. Viscosity can be predicted in the 100–1015 log10 Pa·s range using five different theoretical frameworks (Adam-Gibbs, Free Volume, MYEGA, VFT, Avramov-Milchev), with a precision equal to, or better than, 0.4 log10 Pa·s on unseen data. Density and optical refractive index (through the Sellmeier equation) can be predicted with errors equal or lower than 0.02 and 0.006, respectively. Raman spectra for K2O-Na2O-Al2O3-SiO2 glasses are also predicted, with a relatively high mean error of ∼25% due to the limited data set available for training. Latent variables can also be predicted with good precisions. For example, the glass transition temperature, Tg, can be predicted to within 19 K, while the melt configurational entropy at the glass transition, Sconf(Tg), can be predicted to within 0.8 J mol−1 K−1. Applied to rhyolite compositions, i-Melt shows that the rheological threshold separating explosive and effusive eruptions correlates with an increase in the fraction of non-bridging oxygens in rhyolite melts as their alkali/Al ratio becomes larger than 1. Exploring further the effect of the K/(K + Na) ratio on the properties of alkali aluminosilicate melts with compositions varying along a simplified alkali magmatic series trend, we observe that K-rich melts have systematically different structures and higher viscosities compared to Na-rich melts. Combined with the effects of the K/(K + Na) ratio on other parameters, such as the solubility, solution mechanisms and speciation of volatile elements, this could ultimately influence the eruptive dynamics of volcanic systems emitting Na-rich or K-rich alkali magmas.}, journal={Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta}, author={Le Losq, C. and Valentine, Andrew P. and Mysen, Bjorn O. and Neuville, Daniel R.}, year={2021}, month={Dec}, pages={27–54}, language={en} }

Other properties like viscosity and density of liquids are affected by those elements, and, as such, they can be seen as important variables for geologic and industrial phenomena.

As a result, the usual geochemical discriminants used for the classiﬁcation of the broad range of parental boninites are inapplicable to such highly fractionated melts. These issues are compounded by the mixing of demonstrably different whole-rock and glass analyses in classiﬁcation schemes and petrological interpretations based thereon. Whole-rock compositions are compromised by entrainment of variable proportions of crystalline phases resulting in inconsistent differences from corresponding in situ glass analyses, which arguably better reﬂect prior melt compositions. To circumvent such issues, we herein present a robust method for the classiﬁcation of highly fractionated boninite series glasses. This new classiﬁcation leverages the analysis of trace elements, which are much more sensitive to evolutionary processes than major elements, and beneﬁts from the use of unsupervised machine learning as a classiﬁcation tool. The results show that the most fractionated boninite series melts preserve geochemical indicators of their parentage, and highlight the pitfalls of interpreting whole-rock and glass analyses interchangeably.}, number={2}, journal={Journal of Petrology}, author={Valetich, Matthew J and Le Losq, Charles and Arculus, Richard J and Umino, Susumu and Mavrogenes, John}, year={2021}, month={Apr}, pages={egab013}, language={en} }

In turn, magma composition, pressure, temperature and oxygen fugacity affect iron oxidation state and coordination, potentially leading to complex feedbacks associated with magma ascent, degassing and eruption. While equilibrium experiments and models have led to a deep understanding of the role of iron in melts, our knowledge of the effects of disequilibrium processes on iron oxidation state and its structural role in lavas and magmas remains limited. Accordingly, we performed a series of dynamic disequilibrium experiments on a natural melt composition (a phonolite lava from Erebus volcano, Antarctica) at atmospheric pressure, in which oxygen fugacity and temperature were controlled and varied. During the experiments, we continuously measured iron oxidation and coordination using Fe K-edge dispersive X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS). We found that iron oxidation state changes in the phonolite melt are reversible and well reproduced by existing models. Changes in iron oxidation state are driven by joint diffusion of alkali cations and oxygen anions at magmatic temperatures (~ 1000 °C for Erebus phonolite). However, redox diffusion timescales are too slow for any significant oxygen exchange with the atmosphere at the lava/air interface or via air entrainment. Turning to iron coordination, while ­Fe2+ and ­Fe3+ are present mostly in an average five-fold coordination, complex coordination variations decoupled from redox changes were detected. The data suggest transitions between ­Fe3+ in four-fold and six-fold coordination prior to reduction or as a consequence of oxidation. This questions the possible implication of Fe coordination changes in triggering crystallisation of magnetite nanolites upon magma ascent, and, through such crystallisation events, in promoting magma explosivity.}, number={7}, journal={Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology}, author={Le Losq, Charles and Moretti, Roberto and Oppenheimer, Clive and Baudelet, François and Neuville, Daniel R.}, year={2020}, month={Jul}, pages={64}, language={en} }

Traditionally, TiO2 is considered to be a nucleating agent for silicate crystallization but can also be incorporated into the glass network in relatively large amounts as either a network former or modifier depending on its coordination with oxygen. To determine the effect of Ti4+ on the structure of nepheline glass, X-ray and neutron pair distribution function (PDF) analysis paired with Empirical Potential Structure Refinement (EPSR) were conducted and are supplemented with Raman spectroscopy, electron probe microanalysis, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (including Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure, EXAFS). Through these methods, it has been found that up to 15 mol% (16 wt%) TiO2 can incorporate into the glass network as a four-fold coordinated species, with a minor contribution of higher coordinated Ti. Between NaAlTi0.1Si0.9O4 and NaAlTi0.2Si0.8O4, EXAFS suggests a local structure change in the second coordination sphere of Ti, which changes from Ti-Ti to Ti-Al. Raman spectroscopy also suggests that as Ti content increases, the Na environment becomes more ordered. These results suggest that the Ti activity coefficient and its isotopic fractionation for magnetite and other Ti-bearing minerals should be fairly constant in polymerized melts, such as metaluminous and peraluminous rhyolites.}, journal={Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta}, author={Nienhuis, Emily T. and Marcial, José and Robine, Thibaut and Le Losq, Charles and Neuville, Daniel R. and Stennett, Martin C. and Hyatt, Neil C. and McCloy, John S.}, year={2020}, month={Dec}, pages={333–351}, language={en} }

Only, two analytical methods are capable of assessing such speciation: Near InfraRed (NIR) spectroscopy and solid-state 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. It is observed that the apparent water speciation, as a function of total water content, as determined by NIR spectroscopy is nearly the opposite from what the 1H NMR data reveal. Deuterium (2H) NMR and silicon (29Si) NMR report consistent trends in apparent speciation (depolymerization) with those indicated by the 1H NMR data. Compared with four previous NMR studies of hydrous NaAlSi3O8 glasses it is shown that whereas NIR data always report the same apparent systematic variation in the intensity of the 4500 (‘‘X-OH”) and 5200 (‘‘H2O”) cmÀ1 bands with total water content, multiple 1H NMR studies of hydrous NaAlSi3O8 report a wide range in OH/H2O. The discrepancy between the various NMR studies likely reﬂects diﬀerences in how the various glasses were made. Speciﬁcally, quench rate (fast or slow) and synthesis pressure (higher or lower), might impose a strong eﬀect on observed water speciation in glasses via 1H NMR. It is concluded that the application of NIR spectroscopy, speciﬁcally the use of the intensities of the 4500 (‘‘X-OH”) and 5200 (‘‘H2O”) cmÀ1 NIR bands, does not provide an accurate assessment of water speciation in hydrous alumino-silicate glasses.

The oxygen fugacity (f O2) during synthesis varied from highly reduced at two log units below the iron-wustite buﬀer (IW-2.1) to moderately reduced (IW-0.4), spanning much of the magmatic f O2 conditions during late stages of terrestrial accretion. Raman vibrational modes for H2, NH2–, NH3, CH4, CO, CN–, N2, and OH– species are inferred from band assignments in all reduced glasses. The integrated area of Raman bands assigned to N2, CH4, NH3 and H2 vibrations in glasses increases with increasing molar volume of the melt, whereas that of CO decreases. Additionally, with increasing f O2, CO band areas increase while those of N2 decrease, suggesting that the solubility of these neutral molecules is not solely determined by the melt molar volume under reduced conditions. Coexisting with these neutral molecules, other species as CN–, NH2– and OH– are chemically bonded within the silicate network. The observations indicate that, under reduced conditions, (1) H2, NH2–, NH3, CH4, CO, CN–, N2, and OH– species coexist in silicate glasses representative of silicate liquids in a magma ocean (2) their relative abundances dissolved in a magma ocean depend on melt composition, f O2 and the availability of H and, (3) metal-silicate partitioning or degassing reactions of those magmatic volatile species must involve changes in melt and vapor speciation, which in turn may inﬂuence isotopic fractionation.}, journal={Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta}, author={Dalou, Celia and Hirschmann, Marc M. and Jacobsen, Steven D. and Le Losq, Charles}, year={2019}, month={Nov}, pages={32–47}, language={en} }

We tested this method on synthetic forsterite (Fo:[Math Processing Error]Mg2SiO4{text{Mg}}_{2} {text{SiO}}_{4}) crystals. To control starting point defect structures, Fo crystals were pre-annealed at different temperatures ([Math Processing Error]1100−1500∘C1100{-}1500,{^circ }{text{C}}), silica activity conditions (forsterite–enstatite Fo–En and forsterite–periclase Fo–Per) and oxygen fugacity (0.21 and [Math Processing Error]10−610^{-6} bars). Then low-temperature hydroxylation (900 °C, 1.5 GPa) of the crystals successfully allowed the decoration with protons of pre-existing point defect structures, as subsequently revealed by infrared spectroscopy. Protons are arranged in three different point defect stoichiometries in Fo, related to Mg and Si vacancies ([Mg] and [Si], respectively) as well as to a trivalent cation-associated substitution mechanism ([triv]). Over the timescale and equilibrium conditions studied, hydroxylation does not reset the point defect structure inherited from pre-anneal. The data further show that the concentrations of [Mg]-, [Si]- and [triv]-hydrated defects are function of pre-anneal silica activity and temperature. Laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analysis of the crystals revealed diffusion of Al and Fe into the crystals during the pre-annealing, a phenomenon clearly promoted at high [Math Processing Error]aSiO2{text{a}}_{{{text{SiO}}_{2} }}. The data confirm a very fast mechanism of Al diffusion in Fo during pre-annealing, and suggest a strong coupling between [Math Processing Error]H+{text{H}}^{+} and [Math Processing Error]Al3+{text{Al}}^{3+} during hydroxylation. Overall, they show the strong importance of [Math Processing Error]aSiO2{text{a}}_{{{text{SiO}}_{2} }} and temperature in the incorporation of trace cations in forsterite, and the subsequent effects of incorporation of trace cations on Mg- and Si-related point defects in Fo. The dry point defect population of Fo is determined by interactions between the trace trivalent cations and dry Si and Mg vacancies. Without trace elements, T only has a limited effect on Mg- and Si-related point defect populations. Finally, approaching or potentially slightly exceeding the Fo–En solidus leads to strong changes in the trace element concentration and point defect population in Fo, which may be related to either partial melting or pre-melting effects.}, number={6}, journal={Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology}, author={Le Losq, Charles and Jollands, Michael C. and Tollan, Peter M.

As these inclusions are heated up to the critical temperature (373.946 °C), the liquid phase decreases in density and the maximum of the Raman OH-stretching band increases in wavenumber. Conversely, as the vapor phase increases in density, the maximum of the Raman OH-stretching band decreases in wavenumber. The Raman bands of the liquid and vapor phases converge to a single band at the critical point of water, where the ﬂuid exists as a single phase. A comparison of the band centroids for the vapor and liquid phases of water indicates respective increases and decreases in the amount of hydrogen bonding in these phases as a function of increasing and decreasing density. These eﬀects were further quantiﬁed by peak-ﬁtting the Raman OH-stretching peak with ﬁve Gaussian components. All the Gaussian components of the liquid phase decrease in amplitude with increasing temperature with the exception of the double donor−single acceptor (H2O)4 cluster, which increases in amplitude and becomes the most intense component at temperatures above 300 °C. The Raman spectra of the vapor phase are dominated by the free OH component at temperatures below 300 °C, but, above this temperature, the double donor−single acceptor (H2O)4 cluster is again the most intense band. The results indicate that a signiﬁcant quantity of water clusters is present in both liquid and vapor water at high temperatures and that supercritical water can be considered as a mixture of small water clusters [(H2O)n, n = 1−4] dominated by the double donor−single acceptor (H2O)4 cluster.}, number={27}, journal={The Journal of Physical Chemistry B}, author={Zhou, Li and Mernagh, Terrence Patrick and Le Losq, Charles}, year={2019}, month={Jul}, pages={5841–5847}, language={en} }

A key dynamic weakening mechanism during the early stages of slip is flash heating, where stress concentrations at contacts on the interface lead to the rapid generation of heat. Although potential weakening from flash heating has been extensively modeled, there is little recorded microstructural evidence of its physical manifestations. We present results of a series of triaxial experiments on synthetic faults in quartz sandstone. Samples were subjected to a variety of normal stresses and ambient temperatures, to induce a range of slip event sizes and sliding velocities. We show the microstructural evolution of asperity interactions from the onset of flash heating through to the formation of grain-scale areas of sheared melt. Using microstructural observations and mechanical data from the experiments, we model temperature and the viscoelastic behavior of the glass. Results suggest that, in the earliest stages of slip asperity contacts melt, but temperatures remain too low for viscous shear to occur within the melt layer. Instead melted asperities behave as glassy solids, facilitating continued frictional heating. With further slip, increased asperity temperatures allow the transition to viscous shear within the melt layer, facilitating weakening. These results highlight the dynamic evolution of the viscoelastic properties of the melt and resulting effects on asperity strength. Such complexity has, to-date, not been fully addressed in modeling of flash heating.}, number={12}, journal={Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth}, author={Hayward, Kathryn S. and Hawkins, Rhys and Cox, Stephen F. and Le Losq, Charles}, year={2019}, pages={12736–12762}, language={en} }

The veins preserve sulfide-bearing glass coexisting with crystals. The glass formed by the quench of residual liquids left after crystallisation of abundant orthopyroxene, variable amounts of clinopyroxene, and minor olivine and spinel from silicate melts intruding spinel harzburgite. The glass compositions range from low-Ti (≤ 0.2 wt% TiO2), intermediate to magnesian (2–5 wt% MgO) and high-Mg# (0.45–0.6) andesite to dacite, with Mg# = Mg/(Mg + Fet) where Fet indicates all Fe treated as Fe2+. The glass is depleted in moderately incompatible lithophile trace elements and contains 1.2 to 2.5 wt% H2O, 400–1800 ppm Cl and 100–400 ppm S. Thermo-barometric calculations indicate that the original vein-forming melts intruded the shallow sub-arc mantle lithosphere between 0.5 and 1 GPa, where they partially crystallised (50–60%) to form residual liquids during cooling from ~ 1200 °C down to ~ 650 °C. Our data and calculations show that West Bimarck orthopyroxenite veins are of high-temperature magmatic origin and bear no relation to the carrier magmas of the xenoliths. Instead, petrological modelling demonstrates that the veins formed from the intrusion of primitive low-Ca boninite (LCB) melts in the sub-arc mantle lithosphere. These melts were originally produced by low degrees of melting (≤ 5%) of spinel harzburgite at ≥ 1360 °C and ≤ 1.5 GPa. Some key features of the parental LCB vein-forming melts from West Bismarck (e.g. lithophile trace element signatures and moderate volatile abundances and oxygen fugacity) suggest that, contrary to the widely held belief, their formation does not require persistent mantle wedge fluxing by slab-derived components. Instead, we propose that adiabatic decompression melting of spinel harzburgite residues may also form LCB in the sub-arc mantle. West Bismarck veins are very similar to those previously described in mantle xenoliths from the Kamchatka Arc; active boninite magmatism in these mature arcs shows that the generation of these melts is not as restricted as previously thought. In fact, the growing evidence for the prevalence of boninite in sub-arc mantle peridotites is consistent with the presence of boninite-like geochemical components in many island arcs.}, number={12}, journal={Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology}, author={Bénard, Antoine and Le Losq, Charles and Nebel, Oliver and Arculus, Richard J.}, year={2018}, month={Nov}, pages={105}, language={en} }

Considering that such subsystems involve the silicate Qn units (n = number of bridging oxygens), this study presents a model that links the Qn unit fractions to the melt configurational entropy at the glass transition temperature Tg, Sconf(Tg), and finally, to its viscosity η. With 13 adjustable parameters, the model reproduces η and Tg of melts in the Na2O-K2O-SiO2 system (60 ≤ [SiO2] ≤ 100 mol%) with 1σ standard deviations of 0.18 log unit and 10.6°, respectively.
The model helps understanding the links between the melt chemical composition, structure, Sconf and η. For instance, small compositional changes in highly polymerized melts generate important changes in their Sconf(Tg) because of an excess of entropy generated by mixing Si between Q4 and Q3 units. Changing the melt silica concentration affects the Qn unit distribution, this resulting in non-linear changes in the topological contribution to Sconf(Tg). The model also indicates that, at [SiO2] ≥ 60 mol%, the mixed alkali effect has negligible impact on the silicate glass Qn unit distribution, as corroborated by Raman spectroscopy data on mixed Na-K tri- and tetrasilicate glasses. Such model may be critical to link the melt structure to its physical and thermodynamic properties, but its refinement requires further high-quality quantitative structural data on silicate and aluminosilicate melts.}, journal={Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids}, author={Le Losq, C. and Neuville, D.

Raman data were also acquired on Na silicate and Na and Ca aluminosilicate glasses, quenched from hydrous melts equilibrated at high temperature and pressure in a piston cylinder apparatus. In the hydrous melts, temperature strongly influences O-H stretching ν(O-H) signals, reflecting its control on the bonding of protons between different molecular complexes. Pressure and melt composition effects are much smaller and difficult to discriminate with the present data. However, the chemical composition of the melt + fluid system influences the differences between the ν(O-H) signals from the melts and the fluids and, hence, between their hydrogen partition functions. Quenching modifies the O-H stretching signals: strong hydrogen bonds form in the glasses below the glass transition temperature Tg, and this phenomenon depends on glass composition. Therefore, glasses do not necessarily record the O-H stretching signal shape in melts near Tg. The melt hydrogen partition function thus cannot be assessed with certainty using O-H stretching vibration data from glasses. From the present results, the ratio of the hydrogen partition functions of hydrous silicate melts and aqueous fluids mostly depends on temperature and the bulk melt + fluid system chemical composition. This implies that the fractionation of hydrogen isotopes between magmas and aqueous fluids in water-saturated magmatic systems with differences in temperature and bulk chemical composition will be different.}, number={7}, journal={Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth}, author={Le Losq, Charles and Dalou, Célia and Mysen, Bjorn O.}, year={2017}, month={Jul}, pages={4888–4899}, language={en} }

Sulfur is a moderately siderophile element (i.e. iron-loving), and its partitioning into the Earth’s core may have left such a distinctive isotope composition on the terrestrial mantle. In order to constrain the sulfur isotope fractionation occurring during core–mantle differentiation, high-pressure and temperature experiments were conducted with synthetic mixtures of metal and silicate melts. With the purpose to identify the mechanism(s) responsible for the S isotope fractionations, we performed our experiments in different capsules – namely, graphite and boron nitride capsules – and thus at different fO2, with varying major element chemistry of the silicate and metal fractions.

The S isotope fractionations Δ34Smetal–silicate of equilibrated metal alloys versus silicate melts is +0.2 ± 0.1‰ in a boron-free and aluminum-poor system quenched at 1–1.5 GPa and 1650 °C. The isotope fractionation increases linearly with increasing boron and aluminum content, up to +1.4 ± 0.2‰, and is observed to be independent of the silicon abundance as well as of the fO2 over ∼3.5 log units of variations explored here. The isotope fractionations are also independent of the graphite or nitride saturation of the metal. Only the melt structural changes associated with aluminum and boron concentration in silicate melts have been observed to affect the strength of sulfur bonding. These results establish that the structure of silicate melts has a direct influence on the S2− average bonding strengths.

These results can be interpreted in the context of planetary differentiation. Indeed, the structural environments of silicate evolve strongly with pressure. For example, the aluminum, iron or silicon coordination numbers increase under the effect of pressure. Consequently, based on our observations, the sulfur-bonding environment is likely to be affected. In this scheme, we tentatively hypothesize that S isotope fractionations between the silicate mantle and metallic core of terrestrial planetary bodies would depend on the average pressure at which their core–mantle differentiation occurred.}, journal={Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta}, author={Labidi, J. and Shahar, A. and Le Losq, C. and Hillgren, V.

Such understanding relies on the knowledge of the hydrogen isotopic fractionation factors between aqueous fluids, silicate melts, and minerals at temperature and pressure conditions relevant to the Earth’s interior. Significant D/H fractionation between silicate melts and aqueous fluids was reported at hundreds of MPa and °C by using in situ measurements in hydrothermal diamond anvil cell (HDAC) experiments (Mysen, 2013a, 2013b, Am. Mineral. 98, 376–386 and 1754–1764). However, the available dataset is focused on fluids and melts with D/H ratios close to unity. The relevance of such data for natural processes that involve per mil variations of δD-values may not always be clear. To address such concerns, the effect of the bulk D/H ratio on hydrogen isotope partitioning between water-saturated silicate melts and coexisting silicate-saturated aqueous fluids has been determined in the Na2O–Al2O3–SiO2–H2O–D2O system. To this end, in situ Raman spectroscopic measurements were performed on fluids and melts with bulk D/H ratios from 0.05 to 2.67 by using an externally-heated diamond anvil cell in the 300–800 °C and 200–1500 MPa temperature and pressure range, respectively.

In these pressure/temperature ranges, the D/H ratios of fluids in equilibrium with melt barely change with temperature (in average Δ H fluid = 0.47 ± 1.15   kJ / mol ). In contrast, the D/H ratios of coexisting melts display strong dependence on temperature (average Δ H melt = 7.18 ± 1.27   kJ / mol ). The temperature-dependence of the D/H fractionation factor between melt and fluid ( α fluid - melt = D / H fluid / D / H melt ) is comparable in all the experiments and can be written: 1000 ⋅ ln ⁡ ( α fluid - melt ) = 263 ( ± 26 ) ⋅ T − 2 – 126 ( ± 48 ) . Therefore, the αfluid-melt is independent of the bulk D/H ratio of the melt + fluid system.

Experimentally determined αfluid-melt using D-enriched fluids, therefore, can be applied to natural systems. It follows that for water-saturated magma strong isotopic fractionation of D and H between water dissolved in magmas and deep aqueous fluids may occur. The δD-values in melt inclusions in phenocrysts in such water-saturated magma will reflect such fluid/melt fractionation effects. A likely result is underestimation of the δ D isotopic composition of slab fluids based on δD-values in melt inclusions. The temperature-dependent hydrogen isotope fractionation must be taken into account in the modeling of slab fluid–magma interaction in the mantle wedge.}, journal={Earth and Planetary Science Letters}, author={Dalou, C. and Le Losq, C. and Mysen, Bjorn O.}, year={2015}, month={Sep}, pages={158–166} }

Although it exerts a profound influence on properties of magmas, this autoprotolysis reaction has been hitherto neglected for water dissolved in silicate melts. As made here with an acid–base model, in fact one has to deal with molecular water (H2Omol) and two kinds of hydroxyl groups, bonded or not to network-forming cations (OH and OH−, respectively) in hydrous silicate melts. By mixing cations and anions on distinct sublattices and quantifying the disproportionation of water dissolved in silicate melts into its ionic products, H+ and OH−, we reconcile spectroscopic determinations of water speciation, and highlight the main compositional features involving chemical exchanges between H2Omol, TOH and MOH groups (T and M being a former and a modifier, respectively). In particular, water addition to depolymerized systems, such as basalts, determine a relative predominance of OH− with respect to silicic systems, such that the increase of water concentration tends to immediately limit depolymerization rather than enhance it. This opens new perspectives to the understanding of the chemical control of hydrous magmas and their physical properties, as well as the attainment of saturation in hydrous minerals such as amphiboles or micas, particularly in depolymerized melts.}, journal={Chemical Geology}, author={Moretti, Roberto and Le Losq, Charles and Neuville, Daniel R.}, year={2014}, month={Feb}, pages={23–33} }

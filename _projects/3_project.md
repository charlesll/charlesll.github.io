[Rampy is a Python library](https://github.com/charlesll/rampy) is an open source, free Python library that aims at helping processing spectroscopic data, such as Raman, Infrared or XAS spectra.

I built this library for my personal use at first. As time goes on, I integrated various functions to perform regular tasks such as [smoothing](https://github.com/charlesll/rampy/blob/master/examples/Smoothing.ipynb) and [background subtraction](https://github.com/charlesll/rampy/blob/master/examples/Baseline.ipynb) of spectra, but also to [explore them using PCA](https://github.com/charlesll/rampy/blob/master/examples/Baseline.ipynb) or use them in [machine learning regression](https://github.com/charlesll/rampy/blob/master/examples/Machine Learning Regression.ipynb) and [classification](https://github.com/charlesll/rampy/blob/master/examples/MachineLearning_Classification.ipynb) cases.

Rampy is open source, and features are now generally added following user request, so do not hesitate to send me an e-mail if you think it could be improved!

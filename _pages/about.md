I am a geoscientist passionate about magmatism, volcanology, geochemistry, and machine learning. I started as a Master and Ph.D. student at IPGP, working on the properties of magmas. After my thesis, I was a PostDoctoral Fellow at the Geophysical Laboratory, Washington D.C. (U.S.A.), between 2013 and 2015, and a Research Fellow at the Australian National University, Research School of Earth Sciences, between 2015 and 2019. During those years, I was interested by many subjects related to volatile elements dissolved in materials, the properties of magmas, igneous petrology and geochemistry, and machine learning.

Since 2019, I work as a Maître de Conférences (Assistant Professor) at the IPGP in Paris on various topics related to volcanism, magmatism, geochemistry and material science. In addition to those themes, I also am interested in computer programming, optimisation and machine learning, and their use to solve problems related to volcanic systems and the Earth.

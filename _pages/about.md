I am a geoscientist passionate about magmatism, volcanology, geochemistry, and machine learning. 

I work as a Maître de Conférences (Assistant Professor) at IPGP in Paris, France, on various questions related to those themes. I also am a Junior member of the Institut Universitaire de France.

In addition to my interests in the field of geosciences, I am interested in computers, programming, optimisation and machine learning.

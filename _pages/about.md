I am a geoscientist passionate about magmatism, volcanology, geochemistry, and machine learning. 


Since 2019, I work as a Maître de Conférences (Assistant Professor) at IPGP in Paris, France, on various questions related to those themes. 



In addition to those, I also am interested in computer programming, optimisation and machine learning, and their use to solve problems related to volcanic systems and the Earth.

Cl√©ment Ferraina works as a Research Engineer in my group. His work aims at better constraining the properties of silicate melts at high pressure, in particular using diamond anvil cell experiments.

He is expert in experimental petrology and geochemistry (sample synthesis at high temperature and high pressure, including piston-cylinder, autoclave and diamond cell apparatus), and the related analysis methods of experimental and natural samples (e.g. MEB, TEM, Raman/Ir spectroscopy, LA-ICP-MS).

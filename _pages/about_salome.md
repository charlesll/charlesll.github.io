Salom√© Pannefieu works as a Research Engineer in my group. Her work aims at better constraining the properties of silicate melts at high pressure, in particular using diamond anvil cell and piston-cylinder experiments.

She is an expert in materials science, glass, experimental petrology (high temperature synthesis, and piston-cylinder and diamond cell experiments), and the related analysis methods of produced samples (e.g. MEB, NMR and Raman spectroscopy, etc.).

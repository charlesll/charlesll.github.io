Material for the courses I teach at IPGP is available on the Moodle of University Paris Cit√©. 

**Two courses are also available on Github:**

**Geochemical Modelling**: the material of this course I teach at IPGP can be accessed [here](https://github.com/charlesll/ModelisationGeochimie)

**Computational Geoscience Course**: I taught this course while I was a Research Fellow at ANU, with Andrew Valentine and Oscar Branson. It is a good starting point for anyone wanting to learn computing. You can find the material [here](https://github.com/valentineap/ComputationalGeoscienceCourse), updated frequently by Andrew Valentine !

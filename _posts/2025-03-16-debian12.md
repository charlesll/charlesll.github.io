# Setting Up Debian 12 on VirtualBox: A Quick Guide

Some notes regarding my installation of Debian 12 on a virtual machine running on a MacBook Pro 16" 2020 (Intel). I wanted to move away from macOS for coding due to recurring issues with `gfortran` or `ruby/bundler`. Therefore, I aimed to set up a lightweight Linux VM on my laptop for these tasks.

After encountering issues while updating this website, I decided to try Debian 12. The following post contains quick notes regarding the installation of Debian 12 in VirtualBox, in case I need to redo it in the future, and perhaps others may find it useful too!

## Step 1: Download Debian

Download the latest version of Debian directly from the [Debian website](https://www.debian.org/). I used version 12.10.

## Step 2: Install the Latest VirtualBox

Check the available images and instructions on the [VirtualBox website](https://www.virtualbox.org/). I installed version 7.1.6 along with the extension pack.

## Step 3: Run the Automatic Installation

I used the automatic installation feature in VirtualBox, which was new to me and quite convenient. You can specify the username and password in advance.

### Notes:
- The automatic installation of the VBox Guest Additions asks for an ISO image, which I couldn't find initially. However, this can be added later, so it's nothing to worry about.
- Indicate your preferred system settings in the options, then run the automatic installation.

**Post-Installation Note**: The keyboard layout wasn't set up correctly. I had to change it after the first boot. The incorrect layout still appears briefly during boot, but I plan to resolve this later. I also added my username to the sudoer group to be able to use the `sudo` command.

## Step 4: Install VBox Guest Additions

To avoid screen issues and enable shared folders, install the VBox Guest Additions.

1. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) gcc make perl
   ```

2. **Add User to `vboxsf` Group**:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG vboxsf YOURUSERNAME
   ```

3. **Insert VBox Guest Additions ISO**:
   - Shut down Debian.
   - Insert the VBox Guest Additions ISO via VirtualBox settings.
   - Start Debian again.

4. **Run the Installer**:
   - Once Debian starts, you should see the VBox Guest Additions CD in the file browser. Run the installer and enter your superuser password when prompted.

5. **Reboot**:
   - Reboot the system to apply the changes. Graphics and shared folders should now work correctly.

## Ruby and Bundler Setup

I needed Ruby and Bundler to manage this website. Here are some tips to remember:

- **Set the Path for Bundle Gems**:
  ```bash
  bundle config set path /home/USERNAME/.gem
  ```

- **Install Required Libraries for `nokogiri`**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install build-essential patch ruby-dev zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev
  ```

- **Install Gems**:
  ```bash
  bundle install
  ```

This should install the gems in your local folder without any issues.

## Get Miniconda

Miniconda is excellent for managing Python environments. Follow the [official instructions](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install) to install it.

### Why Miniconda?
- Miniconda allows you to create isolated environments for your Python projects, making it easier to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts.

## Future Updates

I will update this post if I encounter any further issues or find additional tips worth sharing.
